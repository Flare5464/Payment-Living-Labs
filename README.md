# Payment Living Labs
An XR eCommerce proof of concept application. The use-case is to enable the purchase of digital goods in a virtual space to acquire digital assets and/or NFTs in a "metaverse" environment and be able to exchange vouchers for physical goods. 
<br />
<br />
This proof of concept was created using Unreal 5 (blueprints), Blender (Custom 3D models), Photoshop (Texture and Image creation). Unreal Marketplace assets and "Metahumans" were also used for 3D models. Created Q4 2022
